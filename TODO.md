# TODO

Items to investigate or correct, from real-world tests. Check items off as they're fixed
and note the commit.

## From Test #1: `2026-11-09_1324_test-meeting-1`

Setup: packaged tray app (`dist\HuddleHelper\HuddleHelper.exe`), base.en, HyperX headset
(mic + loopback), recorded work-meeting video as the remote side, 3 min 54 s.
Keep audio was off, so the audio for this meeting is gone.

What went well: no errors or audio gaps, transcription kept up live (empty backlog at
Stop), final transcript 35 s after Stop, and the final pass found 4 distinct voices.

### Speaker labels

- [ ] **Live labels don't separate real voices.** All 29 system lines in `transcript.jsonl`
  are `SPEAKER_01`; the final pass found 4 speakers. Real voices over compressed call audio
  are more similar than the synthetic TTS voices `live_speaker_threshold` (0.6) was tuned on.
  *Investigate:* measure same-speaker and different-speaker embedding similarity on kept
  real audio, then retune the threshold and `min_new_speaker_s`, or compare against the
  centroids from the last N utterances. Code: `diarize.py` `OnlineClusterer`.
- [ ] **Final pass splits sentences mid-way.** The refined labels split a sentence between
  speakers: "…part of 12.x I think so I did" (`SPEAKER_03`) / "the same with that as well."
  (`SPEAKER_02`).
  *Fix:* only split at a pause or sentence boundary, and don't split off pieces shorter than
  about 1 s / 3 words. Code: `finalize.py` `_split_by_words`.
- [ ] **Final pass flips speaker word by word.** "Who could look at first? I found it. I
  found it. So this is the one…" came out as 4 segments alternating `SPEAKER_01` /
  `SPEAKER_03`. Same fix as above: fold short runs into the neighbouring speaker.
- [ ] **Check whether 4 speakers is right** for this clip (it was 1 in live, 4 in final).
  Needs a recording with known speakers and Keep audio on. `final_cluster_threshold` is 0.6.

### Microphone

- [ ] **Only one mic line was captured:** "This is a test. Yes." (confidence 0.39).
  *Investigate:* confirm how much was said into the mic. If more, check the mic input level
  and the VAD threshold (`vad_threshold` 0.5) and minimum-speech rule on real mic audio.
- [ ] **Mic segment timing is squeezed:** 5 words in 0.56 s (57048–57608 ms). The start and
  end come from Whisper word timestamps clamped to the utterance; one of them is probably
  wrong. Code: `recorder.py` `_transcribe_loop`.

### Measurement

- [ ] **Record line delay for tray recordings.** The tray app doesn't save how long lines take
  to land after speech ends, so the PRD's p90 under 5 s can't be checked from a meeting
  folder. Write median/p90 delay and maximum backlog to `meta.json` at Stop. (`record` and
  `simulate` on the command line already print it.)

### Transcription quality

- [ ] **base.en mishears names and jargon**, e.g. "Gitli Cluster" (probably "GitLab").
  *Investigate:* run `huddle-helper bench` with small.en on the target laptop. If it keeps
  up with real time, consider making it the default.

### Process

- [ ] Turn on **Settings → Keep audio after the final transcript** for test recordings, so
  findings can be reproduced and tuned against the real audio.

## Still open from the PRD milestones

- [ ] M1: 30-minute capture spike on a real call (`capture-spike --minutes 30`).
- [ ] M6: 2-hour soak test (lag, memory, dropped lines).
- [ ] Switch the default audio device mid-call and confirm rebind and the `gaps` entry in `meta.json`.
- [ ] Echo dedupe on real speakers (no headset): remote speech must not appear as "You".
